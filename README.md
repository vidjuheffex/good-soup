# Good Soup

Good Soup is a film developing helper primarily geared for folks home-developing. I created it to address a few shortcomings I found in some of the existing apps and gear, mainly:

- Inability to easily track exhaustion rates and use.
- Lack of helpers for mixing chemicals other than developers
- Lackluster interfaces ranging from physical film-mixing hardware to applications that are inflexible.

## Features

- 🧪 Chemical recipes: Create your favorite brews
- ⚗️ Mixes: Track your chemistry cabinet virtually, keeping tabs on expiration dates, exhaustion rates, and providing mixing ratio guidance.
- 🎞️ Film stocks/Film groups: Track recipes alongside the filmstocks you use.
- ⏱️ Timers: Track your timing and inversion cycles for every step of the developing process

## Coming soon:

- 🟢 Color status indicators: No longer a fixed green, this will turn yellow to red as you exhaust or expire your chemicals.
- ✏️ Editing / Deleting: You make it, you keep it! (But pretty soon, yeah, you also edit and delete it.)
- 🔄 Max re-use: Re-use will keep counting up, but will power the red dot to remind you to mix some fresh chems
- 💦 Wash/Water steps: Debating between a magic chemical "water" that has amount set to Math.Infinity and can be used steps or adding a wash step as a seperate step from the chemical steps with options better suited for washing: "tank refill cycles" / "running water" etc.
- 📝 Development details: Processing a 120 roll? How about fifteen 135 rolls? This affects exhaustion and we'll track it soon enough.
- 👯 Duplicate recipes / move recipes into other film stocks
- 🖖 Split chemicals: Make 1000ml but want to use 600ml at a time? This is common and we'll cover this use-case.

## Coming later:

- 🗣️ Gesture tracking / voice tracking: not sure which, depends which goes smoother to implement and gives a more reliable experience, but it would be nice not to get chemicals on your 'puter.
- 🎨 A better UI. This UI is focused more on UX. I want how you input data, what's visible when, to come first and foremost in these early passes of the app. As such the UI is purposefully minimal for the time being.
- 🫗 Replish rates/mixes. eg: Rapid Fixer can be refreshed with some fresh chemicals and end up lasting a VERY long time.
